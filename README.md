## **Description:**
This web app project is my final submission to Harvard CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course. See the “About CS50” section below for more information about this course.

PAO Cards is a web application designed to help users improve their memory skills by using the Person-Action-Object (PAO) system. The PAO system is a widely accepted technique for mastering the memorization of long random numbers and playing card decks used by memory champions around the world. By grouping cards together into unique images and storing them in memory palaces, users can easily recall them at a later time.

This application is built using a combination of programming languages and frameworks, including Python with the Flask web framework, Jinja for page rendering, HTML for markup, SQL for data storage, and JavaScript for additional functionality. Styling is done using Bootstrap and custom CSS.

The main structure of the application is built using Flask, which allows for the creation of web applications using Python and Jinja. Data is stored in a SQLite database, consisting of three tables: a user table for storing user information, a standard cards table for storing information about the standard deck, and a custom cards table for storing user-created PAO parameters for each card. Additionally, the flask.url_for() method was used to dynamically generate URLs throughout the application, making it easier to change or update the URLs without hardcoding them.
